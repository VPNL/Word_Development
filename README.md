# Word_Development

This is the code that generates the main Figures of the publication: Nordt, M., Gomez, J., Natu, V., Jeska, B., Barnett, M., & Grill-Spector, K. (2018). Cerebral Cortex (https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy178)

## Structure
All data required to generate the main Figures is stored in the “data” directory. Functions required to run the code are saved in the “functions” directory. The figures created by the code will be saved in the “figures” directory.
Clone the “Word_Development” repository to your computer and navigate to the base directory (~/Word_Development/). To execute the script, type the name of the script corresponding to the Figure in the MATLAB command window (for instance “Fig_3.m”).
